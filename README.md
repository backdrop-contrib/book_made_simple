# Book Made Simple

This module will create a main book page for a content type selected in the
BookMadeSimple settings. This is a shortcut to create a node and click on
Update book outline.

A dropdown listbox can be added in book content links. Selecting a content type
here will open a new content form with book settings pre-selected to make this
new page a child page of page you started on.
